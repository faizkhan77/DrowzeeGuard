# DrowzeeGuard  

**DrowzeeGuard** is a lightweight drowsiness detection application designed to help prevent accidents by detecting if a person appears drowsy or awake. The app supports image and video uploads, live detections (GPU recommended), and even bulk dataset processing. Itâ€™s built with Flask to keep things simple and effective.  

## Demo  

### Image/Video Detection

## Features  
- Upload images, videos, or entire folders for quick detection.  
- Live detection using a webcam (requires GPU for best performance).  
- ZIP download of bulk detection results.  
- Built with YOLOv5 for accurate and fast detection.  

## Folder Structure  

- **app.py**: Main Flask app where all detection logic is implemented.
- **Proper_Drowsiness_Detection_using_YOLOv11.ipynb**: Contains the entire step how i fine tuned the YOLO11 model on custom dataset
- **best.py**: Fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for gesture detection.
- **collect_images.py**: Script for collecting images to create a custom dataset.
- **web_cam_detection.py**: A test script for live gesture detection using the fine-tuned model.
- **templates/**: Contains all the HTML files for the web application design.
- **static/**: Holds the CSS files, uploaded files, and detected output files.
- **runs/**: YOLOv11 folder containing the detected output files.
